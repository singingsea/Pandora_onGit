#Schedule used to check tracker performance

#This schedule is typically used after intrument installation and manual sun alignment (i.e. routine FI) to check the performance of the tracker.
#It simply alternates between a sun search (FA) and a sequence of tracker-movements in all directions (TR).
#If the tracker performs well, then the sun searches will be successful (i.e. small angular offsets in the FA routine).
#If the tracker is defective, then the sun searches will not be successful.
#This schedule is usually not run for more than about 30min.
